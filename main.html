		A home is a place of residence or refuge.
		[1] When it refers to a building, it is usually a <br>place in which an individual 
		or a family can live and store personal property. <br>Most modern-day households contain sanitary facilities and<br> a means of preparing food. 
		Animals have their own homes as well, either living in the <br>wild or shared with humans in a domesticated environment.<br> 
		"Home" is also used to refer to the geographical area <br>(whether it be a suburb, town, city or country) in which a person grew up <br>or 
		feels they belong, or it can refer to the native <br>habitat of a wild animal. Sometimes, as an alternative to the <br>
		definition of "home" as a physical locale<br> ("Home is where you hang your hat"), home may be perceived <br>to have no physical location, 
		instead, home may relate instead to a<br> mental or emotional state of refuge or comfort. <br>
		Popular sayings along these lines are <br>"Home is where the heart is" or "You can never go home again".<br>
		There are cultures in which homes are mobile such as nomadic peoples.<br>
